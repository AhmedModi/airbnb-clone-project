# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive full-stack application inspired by Airbnb. It aims to simulate the development of a robust booking platform, emphasizing backend development, database design, API security, and deployment pipelines. The project provides hands-on experience with industry-grade technologies and workflows, encouraging collaborative development and scalable architecture.

### Project Goals

- Build a scalable, secure web application that mimics core features of Airbnb.
- Gain real-world experience in backend engineering, database modeling, and API development.
- Learn CI/CD practices and secure software deployment strategies.

## Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Backend Developer** | Builds and maintains server-side logic using Django, including API endpoints, business logic, and integrations. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Designs and manages MySQL databases, optimizes queries, handles migrations, and ensures data integrity. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Sets up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker, manages deployment workflows and environment automation. |
| **Security Specialist** | Implements authentication, authorization, encryption, and rate limiting to protect sensitive data and APIs. |
| **Project Manager** | Coordinates team collaboration, manages timelines, documents progress, and ensures milestone delivery. |

---

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Django** | High-level Python web framework used to develop RESTful APIs and handle business logic. |
| **MySQL** | Relational database used for storing and managing application data efficiently. |
| **GraphQL** | A flexible query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. |
| **Docker** | Containerization tool that ensures consistent development and deployment environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automation tool for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). |
| **Markdown** | Used for writing well-structured documentation, including the `README.md` file. |

---

## Database Design

| Entity | Fields | Relationships |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **User** | id, name, email, password, role | A user can create multiple properties and make bookings. |
| **Property** | id, title, description, location, owner_id | A property belongs to a user (owner). |
| **Booking** | id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date | A booking is made by a user for a property. |
| **Review** | id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment | A review is written by a user for a property. |
| **Payment** | id, booking_id, amount, status, transaction_date | A payment is linked to a booking. |

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profile. Roles may include host or guest.

- **Property Management**  
  Hosts can list properties with descriptions, images, and availability dates.

- **Booking System**  
  Guests can search for properties and book available listings for specific dates.

- **Review System**  
  Users can leave ratings and reviews for properties they have stayed in.

- **Payment Integration**  
  Secure payment gateway simulation for handling transactions between guests and hosts.

---

## API Security

- **Authentication**  
  Use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Django’s built-in auth system to verify user identity.

- **Authorization**  
  Role-based access control ensures only hosts can add properties, and only guests can book.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Prevents abuse of APIs by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given timeframe.

- **Data Protection**  
  Encrypt sensitive user data like passwords, and use HTTPS to secure data in transit.

> **Why it matters:** API security protects user data, prevents unauthorized access, and builds trust in the platform—especially for bookings and payment-related features.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines streamline the software delivery process by automating testing, integration, and deployment.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tasks like testing code, building Docker containers, and deploying to production.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments from development to deployment.
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean** (optional): Cloud platforms for hosting the application.

> A well-designed CI/CD pipeline reduces manual errors, ensures code reliability, and accelerates delivery of new features.

## Final Notes

This project simulates building a production-grade application. Every line of code, every commit, and every deployment is a step toward becoming a more experienced, industry-ready backend developer.
